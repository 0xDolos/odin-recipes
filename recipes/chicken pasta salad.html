        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This super savory pasta salad is a 
            hit at barbecues and potlucks, and hearty 
            enough to qualify as a meal. (In fact, it's kind of 
            meal prep gold!) Swapping in a tangy mustard vinaigrette 
            for the usual mayo-based dressing lightens things 
            up a bit, and a healthy serving of seared chicken 
            and crispy bacon make it satisfying enough to be a 
            meal all on its own.</p>
