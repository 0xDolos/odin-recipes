        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>We LOVE a good reuben sandwich. This breakfast 
                play layers corned beef with melted Sargento® 
                Sliced Swiss—it’s 100% Real, natural cheese—and 
                a runny egg on an English muffin. Ready in just 
                20 minutes, it’s the perfect way to start your 
                day. Pro tip: We swapped the classic sauerkraut 
                for a super quick and refreshingly lemony slaw 
                made with Brussels sprouts. We promise, you won’t 
                miss it.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, 
                            combine all the dressing ingredients, 
                            set aside.</li>
                        <li>Make the slaw: In a medium bowl, 
                            combine the Brussels sprouts with 
                            oil and lemon juice. Season with salt 
                            and pepper and toss to coat. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Make the sandwich: In a large nonstick 
                            skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over 
                            medium. Crack eggs into the pan. Season 
                            with salt and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, 
                            or until white is almost completely set. 
                            Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes more until 
                            the yolk is just barely runny. Remove 
                            eggs to a plate and keep warm.</li>
                        <li>Add remaining tablespoon of oil to 
                            the skillet and return to medium heat. 
                            Fold each piece of corned beef in thirds 
                            and arrange in skillet. Top each piece of 
                            corned beef with 2 slices of Swiss cheese. 
                            Cover skillet and cook until cheese is 
                            melted and corned beef is warmed, 1 to 2 
                            minutes. </li>
                        <li>Spoon dressing over the bottom of 
                            each English muffin and top each with 
                            an egg and a piece of cheese-topped 
                            corned beef. Pile slaw on top, sandwich, 
                            and serve.</li>
