                </ul>
            
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large straight-sided skillet over 
                        medium-high heat, heat oil. Add bell pepper, 
                        shallot, and garlic and cook, stirring, 
                        until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Increase 
                        heat to high and add chicken, chile, and 
                        white pepper. Cook, breaking up meat with a 
                        wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until 
                        chicken is just cooked through and any liquid 
                        is absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Add green beans, oyster sauce, fish sauce, 
                        and brown sugar and stir to combine. Cook, 
                        stirring frequently, until green beans are 
                        crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Remove from 
                        heat and stir in basil until just wilted, 
                        about 20 seconds. Scrape chicken mixture into 
                        a large bowl. </li>
                    <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and 
                        cook rice, stirring constantly, until very 
                        lightly toasted, about 30 seconds. Pour in 
                        milk, water, lime juice, and 1/2 teaspoon 
                        salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce 
                        heat to low. Gently simmer until rice is 
                        tender and liquid is absorbed, 16 to 18 
                        minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and return 
                        chicken mixture to skillet, spooning over 
                        rice. Cover and cook until chicken mixture 
                        is heated through, about 1 minute more.</li>
